# ModernExcel - alpha
 
The typical Excel file is a mess. Modernize the files you inherit by automatically applying best practices. Inspired by [you suck at excel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nbkaYsR94c).

ModernExcel aims to bring the modern programming standard of [linting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) to excel.
